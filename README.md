### Professional JavaScript Testing with Kent C. Dodds

## Authentication

You must copy `.env.development.template` to `env.development` and acquire a client ID from your local dev server https://egghead.af:5000/oauth/applications/new while logged in as an admin.

From there you can just make an app (uncheck confidential) and copy the client ID into `env.development`.

You will also need a `BUNDLE_BUDDY_TOKEN` in your `env.development`. This can be generated by logging into your rails console with `rails c` and:

```
# might require `rake data:migrate`
user = User.find_by_email('bundle.buddy+bot@egghead.io')
user.access_tokens.create
```

Also, remember to `rake staging:update_local_dev_database` to get all the content.
