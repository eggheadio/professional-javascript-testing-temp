### Professional JavaScript Testing with Kent C. Dodds

## Authentication

You must copy `.env.development.template` to `env.development` and acquire a client ID from your local dev server https://egghead.af:5000/oauth/applications/new while logged in as an admin.

From there you can just make an app (uncheck confidential) and copy the client ID into `env.development`.
